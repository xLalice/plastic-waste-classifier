# Automated Solid Waste Classifier (96% Accuracy)

A full-stack web application that uses a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model to classify five types of recyclable waste with 96% accuracy.

This was a capstone project for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at ICCT Colleges.

## Key Features

- **High-Accuracy Classification**: Achieved 96% overall accuracy on an unseen test set of 989 images.

- **5 Waste Classes**: Correctly identifies:
  - PET Bottles
  - HDPE Containers
  - Aluminum Cans
  - Cardboard
  - Glass Bottles

- **Modern AI Model**: Built using a two-stage fine-tuning process on a MobileNetV2 model in TensorFlow/Keras.

- **Full-Stack Application**:
  - **Backend**: A RESTful API built with FastAPI serves the trained model.
  - **Frontend**: A responsive, mobile-first web interface built with React and TypeScript.
